## Welcome!

This repository holds code for a predictive model built to determine whether a person is doing an exercise correctly. The training data comes from the [Human Activity Recognition project](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). The model detailed in this repo was built using the techniques discussed in the Coursera course on Practical Machine Learning.
